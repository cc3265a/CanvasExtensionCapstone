# Tabs for Canvas Extension
Developed by: Julia Johnson and Rin Carroll
Programmed in: HTML, Javascript

# Overview
A fairly simple extension that can be used to add and indent into code written for a quiz in canvas, especially while learning to work with python, where indenting your code is all-important to demonstrating an understanding of the programming language.

# To Use 
Download the entire code base - the two files you will primarily need is the manifest.json and the content.js file. Once you have them downloaded, to use in firefox, you will need to navigate to the website built into firefox at the link: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

Once you have navigated to that website, there will be a section that reads "Temporary Extensions" with a button that reads "Load Temporary Add-on...". Select that button and then load the content.js file into it. From there, the software should run as needed across canvas pages.
